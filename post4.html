    <h1>First feedback</h1>

      <p>Hello Sydney,

        Thank you for submitting your “Who Am I?” form. The feedback given here is for you to use when you start the program, so you don’t have to respond to it just now.
        
        I read on your motivation that you are interested in cybersecurity. Have you already learned something about it?
        
        Our program for the first year focuses mostly on programming (HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, Laravel Framework) and the first project will be to build a website. But we start with a static HTML/CSS website, no fancy responsive UI at first. It is also good that you are already thinking about Software Engineering. But did you also check the different tracks of our program? During the second year, you will get better acquainted with Business Consultancy and Data Science and will have the chance to make a definitive choice.
        
        The first year is also very hands-on: A class or workshop in the morning, followed by small assignment (individual or in group) and coming back for checkpoint at the afternoon to discuss the findings. Besides, you will get more complex assignments on a weekly basis. There are also team projects during the second, third and fourth quartiles. Next to development, you will also apply a professional way of work (with Agile Scrum methodology)
        
        From your SWOT analysis: being a listener is a very good skill when working on a team, but don't forget to find your voice and contribute. </p>
      
      <p>This was my first feedback from Paula from my "Who am i" form.</p>
