            <p>Hi! Im Sydney!! so, ive always been into ICT i just did not know where to start. This past period ive
                already learned
                so much.
               
            </p>

            <p>i have always liked to learn new stuff and since i found ICT very intersting
                i thought i'd give it a try, im far from good but i learn new stuff everyday!
                please do not expect much
                from my website,
                this is the first one ive ever made.</p>

            <p>Here is a list with subjects i would like to learn more about:</p>
            <img src="img/foto kind sydney.jpg" alt="cyber-sercurity" width="200" height="200">
    
            <ul>
                <li>Cybersecurity</li>
                <li>Graphic designer</li>
                <li>Ethical hacking</li>
                <li>Web design</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="uitleg-ict">
            <p>Even though I may not be highly skilled yet, my eagerness to learn makes me a great fit for a
                school-career
                in ICT. Im drawn to the field because of the vast potential it offers for growth and
                development. I really like to learn and that reflects a desire to tackle challenges and figure things
                out,
                and Im
                excited to apply that mindset to learning the complexities of the ICT-world.</p>

            <p> But the deeper explanation about why i want to study ICT is a little bit deeper, people have always
                underastimated me, i want to show them what i got even though i have no experience whatsoever..</p>
